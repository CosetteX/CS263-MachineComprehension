The 53-year-old, of Hengoed, Caerphilly, admitted a string of offences, including theft and fraud. He was jailed for three years and four months at Cardiff Crown Court. Judge Michael Fitton QC told him: \"You have an arrogant and controlling personality. \"You spoke about these adults being fragile and vulnerable and what you have done is exploited them.\" Harvey, who has had children with nine different women, spent ten years taking benefits from eight \"disadvantaged\" family members and friends, including his brother. Prosecutor Timothy Evans said he took control of post office and bank cards and helped himself to more than Â£22,000 of their money - giving the victims smaller amounts to live on. \"It was deliberate and sustained abuse of vulnerable members of his own family,\" he said. \"He acted in a truly predatory way and was seen by these people as a friend. Harvey's offences were uncovered by an investigation by the Wales Illegal Money Lending Unit. When interviewed by police, he told officers \"he was the patriarch of the family\" who was carrying on what his father taught him. Harvey has been unemployed for the last 16 years and claims Disability Support Allowance for epilepsy, diabetes, asthma and depression.

{"article": "East Street, Hammet Street and St James' Street in Taunton will be closed to cars during the day in the 18-month trial due to start in the autumn. Buses will still use East Street. Roger Habgood from Taunton Deane Borough Council said: \"We're trying to improve the town for all of us.\" But critics said it was \"stupid\" and would increase congestion. The plans, which were posted on BBC Somerset's Facebook page, attracted nearly 300 comments with some welcoming the move but the majority fearing it would cause more congestion. Sheila Jordan wrote: \"This is an absolutely stupid idea, how do the council think this will help the every day pressure of the roads and constant queues at rush hour, people are already fed up to the back teeth that nothing is being done to help this.\" Another tweet from Laura Webber said: \"They're trying to pedestrianise the whole of Taunton town centre except for buses. As if traffic wasn't bad enough already.\" Mr Habgood said: \"We're pretty sure it will be popular because it was when East Street was closed for other reasons and we want to make it a friendlier place to be. \"It does fit with our larger objectives to improve the town and make it safer for cyclists and pedestrians.\" Colin Barrell, president of Taunton Chamber of Commerce said he was concerned disabled people would be unable to park close to shops. He also said retailers would be concerned about a loss of footfall.

{"article": "The pair, who won the first point as Europe won at Gleneagles in 2014, tee off at 13:35 BST against Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed. Rory McIlroy and Andy Sullivan face Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, Sergio Garcia and Martin Kaymer take on Jimmy Walker and Zach Johnson, while Thomas Pieters and Lee Westwood play Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar. The three-day event at Hazeltine National in Minnesota begins with the alternate shot foursomes and four fourball matches will follow, with the pairings to be announced on Friday. Saturday sees the foursomes and fourballs reversed before the contest is decided with all 12 players going head-to-head in singles matches. Englishman Rose and Stenson of Sweden, who won gold and silver respectively at the Rio Olympics in August, claimed three points as a pair two years ago, including their opening fourball match to set Europe on the way to a 16½-11½ victory. However, Spieth and Reed also went unbeaten last time out in Scotland, winning two fourballs and halving their only foursomes match. At Gleneagles, the foursomes were played after the fourballs and Europe won that format by a combined score of 7-1. European captain Darren Clarke has picked six rookies in his squad and England's Sullivan will be the first to play, going out second with Northern Ireland's McIlroy. They face Mickelson and Fowler who have played together just once before at the Ryder Cup, losing a fourball match in 2010. The only other rookie in the opening session is Belgian Pieters. He will play with Westwood, who is making his 10th appearance and is the most experienced member of the team. Westwood, 43, has won 23 points and needs just two more to equal the European, and Ryder Cup record of 25 set by fellow Englishman Nick Faldo. Clarke defended his decision not to play a third rookie in Masters champion Danny Willett, who has spent the past couple of days apologising for an \"ill-timed and wrong\" article written by his brother. When asked if he had intended to play Willett with Westwood in Friday's foursomes, Clarke replied: \"No.\" He added: \"Danny will be playing in the afternoon (fourballs). He is fine and is disappointed like all the guys not playing, but he understands what I am trying to do is for the team. \"Danny may well play four times, the last being his Sunday singles match.\" Clarke also said that all his rookies \"will play before the singles\", however he added that the state of the match would dictate if they all played on Friday.", "question": "Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson will lead Europe 's @placeholder to win a fourth successive Ryder Cup against the United States in Friday 's opening foursomes .", "option_0": "challenge", "option_1": "comeback", "option_2": "attempt", "option_3": "quartet", "option_4": "chances", "label": 0}
